# Platform


[M3O](https://m3o.com) is a platform for cloud native development.

## Overview

M3O is Micro as a Service. We take the open source framework (v3 and beyond) and host it as a service in the cloud. 
Think managed kubernetes, elasticsearch, etc or how we prefer to see it git and github. Git is a phenomenal tool 
for distributed version control and GitHub provides essentially git hosting as a service.

We see Micro as a fantastic tool for writing cloud native services and M3O is essentially Micro hosted as a service.

## Getting Started

Visit the [getting started](/getting-started) guide if you just want to get started.

## How it works

M3O is a cloud service which lets you use Micro without having to manage infrastructure. We run highly available 
systems on managed kubernetes in the cloud e.g etcd, nats, cockroachdb and then provide a shared multi-tenant 
experience. From your standpoint its simply Micro hosted for you. For us its scratching an itch to fix 
the pain points with using AWS and other cloud providers.

As a developer you should just be able to focus on writing code but not just a single app, multiple applications 
and various design patterns in a way that's not limiting but removes choice and friction in a way that let's 
you be super productive. Micro + M3O is just that!

So how does it work?

You signup, pay a flat subscription of $35/month and get unlimited hosting for your services. That's it.

## Next Steps
