## Account Recovery

Issue `micro signup --recover --email=youremail` which will email you instructions on how to log in to namespaces you have access to.
Currently there is no password recovery functionality, please contact us on Slack to do that.

## Additional Users

You can add upto 5 additional users on the dev tier. Every additional user added to your account is billed at $35/month. Whether you invite 
them or just plain create the account we'll keep track and invoice this as "M3O Additonal Users" on your invoices. See 
[Get Started > Invite Users](/getting-started/invite-users) to see how to invite them.

## Additional Services

Beyond 10 services, we bill every additional service at $3/month. Additional service meaning anything with a new unique name
e.g users, customers, orders. We'll add a line item on your invoice called "M3O Additional Services" automatically.
